# Class Note: Structured Programming (Session 7)

## Overview
Structured programming is a methodology that promotes writing clear, organized, and maintainable code using well-defined control structures and modular design. It relies on **sequence**, **selection**, and **iteration** to create programs that are easy to understand and modify. This session explores principles like modularity, top-down design, and the use of procedures, implemented in pseudocode and flowcharts. By the end of this class, you will be able to design modular algorithms, write structured pseudocode, and create flowcharts for efficient, readable programs.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the core principles of structured programming.
- Apply sequence, selection, and iteration control structures in program design.
- Create modular programs using procedures in pseudocode.
- Use top-down design to decompose complex problems into simpler modules.
- Develop flowcharts and pseudocode for structured solutions to practical problems.
