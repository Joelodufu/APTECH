The course emphasizes practical applications through data analysis and interpretation.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this course, students will be able to:
1. Understand the purpose and application of key inferential statistical tests (t-tests, ANOVA, chi-square).
2. Formulate and test null and alternative hypotheses.
3. Interpret p-values, confidence intervals, and effect sizes.
4. Differentiate between parametric and non-parametric tests.
5. Apply regression analysis to predict variable relationships.
6. Understand the properties of normal distributions and their implications.
