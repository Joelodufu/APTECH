- **Short Explanation**: “Let’s create a basic machine learning model to predict a value.”  
- **Code Snippet**:  
  import pandas as pd  
  from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression  
  # Sample data  
  data = pd.DataFrame({'YearsExperience': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 'Salary': [30, 35, 40, 45, 50]})  
  # Define model  
  model = LinearRegression()  
  model.fit(data[['YearsExperience']], data['Salary'])  
  # Predict  
  prediction = model.predict([[6]])  
  print("Predicted salary for 6 years:", prediction)  
- **Expected Output**: Predicted salary for 6 years: [55.]  
- **Key Tips / Mistakes to Avoid**:  
  - Ensure your data is clean (no missing values).
