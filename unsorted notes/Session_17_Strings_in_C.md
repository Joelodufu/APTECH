# ðŸ“˜ Session 17: Strings in C

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

By the end of this session, you should be able to:

- Understand what strings are in C.
- Use pointers to manipulate and access strings.
- Perform input and output operations with strings.
- Apply standard string functions from `<string.h>`.
- Pass arrays and strings to functions.
- Write simple programs that manipulate strings in C.

## ðŸ“Œ 1. Concept of Strings in C

### Definition:
In C, a string is a sequence of characters terminated by a null character `\0`.

### Explanation:
A string is simply a character array. When we define a string like `"Hello"`, it is stored in memory as:
```
'H' 'e' 'l' 'l' 'o' '\0'
```
The null character signifies the end of the string.

### Example:
```c
char name[] = "John";
```
This creates a character array with 5 elements: `'J'`, `'o'`, `'h'`, `'n'`, and `\0`.

### Classwork:
Declare and initialize a string variable that stores your first name and print it using `printf`.

---

## ðŸ“Œ 2. Pointers to Strings

### Definition:
A pointer to a string is a pointer to the first character of a null-terminated character array.

### Explanation:
Instead of storing the entire string in an array, we can use a pointer to refer to a string literal stored in memory.

### Example:
```c
char *name = "Alice";
printf("%s", name);
```
This prints "Alice".

### Classwork:
Create a pointer to a string containing your last name and print it.

---

## ðŸ“Œ 3. String Input and Output Functions

### Definition:
C provides several ways to read and print strings.

### Explanation:

#### Input:
- `scanf("%s", str);` â€” Reads a word.
- `fgets(str, size, stdin);` â€” Reads a line safely.

#### Output:
- `printf("%s", str);` â€” Prints a string.
- `puts(str);` â€” Prints a string followed by a newline.

### Example:
```c
char name[30];
printf("Enter your name: ");
fgets(name, 30, stdin);
puts(name);
```

### Classwork:
Write a program that asks the user to enter their favorite food and prints it.

---

## ðŸ“Œ 4. Various String Functions

### Definition:
The `<string.h>` library provides built-in functions to manipulate strings.

### Explanation & Examples:

| Function         | Description                          | Example |
|------------------|--------------------------------------|---------|
| `strlen(str)`    | Returns length of string             | `int len = strlen("Hello");` |
| `strcpy(dest, src)` | Copies one string to another    | `strcpy(name, "Bob");` |
| `strcat(dest, src)` | Concatenates two strings        | `strcat(greet, name);` |
| `strcmp(a, b)`   | Compares two strings                 | `if(strcmp(a,b)==0)` |
| `strchr(str, ch)` | Finds a character in a string      | `strchr(str, 'a');` |

### Classwork:
Write a program to:
- Read two strings from user
- Compare them using `strcmp`
- Print whether they are equal or not

---

## ðŸ“Œ 5. Passing Arrays as Function Arguments

### Definition:
Arrays in C are passed to functions as pointers to their first element.

### Explanation:
When you pass an array, you're actually passing the address of its first element.

### Example:
```c
void printArray(int arr[], int size) {
    for(int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
        printf("%d ", arr[i]);
    }
}
```

### Classwork:
Write a function that accepts an array of integers and prints all its values.

---

## ðŸ“Œ 6. Passing Strings as Function Arguments

### Definition:
You can pass a string to a function the same way you pass an array â€” as a pointer.

### Explanation:
Since strings are arrays, functions can receive them as `char str[]` or `char *str`.

### Example:
```c
void greet(char name[]) {
    printf("Hello, %s\n", name);
}
```

### Classwork:
Write a function that takes a string and prints "Welcome, [name]!"

## ðŸ§ª Lab Practice â€“ TL13

Practice all the concepts from this session:

- String declarations and input
- Using pointers to strings
- Using string functions from `<string.h>`
- Passing strings to functions
- Implementing small string-based programs

---

## âœ… Summary

- Strings are character arrays ending with `\0`.
- Pointers can simplify string handling.
- Use `<string.h>` for common string tasks.
- You can pass strings/arrays to functions easily in C.
