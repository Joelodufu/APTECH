## Step-by-Step Installation Guide

### Step 1: Verify System Requirements
1. **Check Your Operating System**:
   - Ensure you’re using Windows 10 or higher.
   - Go to *Settings > System > About* and check the “Windows specifications” section.
   - If you’re on Windows 8 or earlier, upgrade to Windows 10 or higher (contact your IT support if needed).
2. **Check Hardware**:
   - Confirm you have an Intel Core i3/i5 processor or better, at least 8 GB RAM, and 500 GB free disk space.
   - Open *This PC* (File Explorer), right-click your main drive (usually C:), and select *Properties* to check free space.
   - If your system doesn’t meet these requirements, consider upgrading RAM or freeing up disk space.

### Step 2: Download SQL Server 2022
1. **Visit the Official Microsoft Website**:
   - Open a web browser (e.g., Chrome, Edge) and go to [Microsoft SQL Server 2022 Download](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads).
2. **Choose the Developer Edition**:
   - Select the **Developer Edition** (free for non-production use, ideal for learning).
   - Click *Download now* under “Developer” to download the installer (e.g., `SQL2022-SSEI-Dev.exe`).
   - Save the file to a location like your *Downloads* folder (file size is ~1.5–2 GB).
3. **Why Developer Edition?**:
   - It’s free and includes all Enterprise features, perfect for the course’s hands-on exercises.

### Step 3: Install SQL Server 2022
1. **Run the Installer**:
   - Navigate to your *Downloads* folder and double-click the downloaded file (e.g., `SQL2022-SSEI-Dev.exe`).
   - If prompted by User Account Control (UAC), click *Yes* to allow the installer to run.
2. **Select Installation Type**:
   - In the SQL Server Installation Center, choose *Basic* for a beginner-friendly setup (or *Custom* for more control, but *Basic* is recommended).
   - Click *Basic* and then *Accept* to agree to the license terms.
3. **Choose Installation Location**:
   - Accept the default installation path (e.g., `C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server`) or choose a custom location with at least 10 GB free space.
   - Click *Install* to begin the installation (this may take 10–20 minutes).
4. **Configure SQL Server**:
   - The installer sets up a default instance named `MSSQLSERVER`.
   - Note the *Instance ID* and *Server Name* (e.g., `localhost` or your computer name) shown at the end of the installation.
   - Select *Windows Authentication* (uses your Windows login) for simplicity; no need to set a password for now.
5. **Verify Installation**:
   - Once complete, the installer displays a success message with connection details.
   - Save or screenshot the *Server Name* (e.g., `YOUR-PC-NAME\MSSQLSERVER`) for use in SSMS.

### Step 4: Download SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)
1. **Visit the SSMS Download Page**:
   - Go to [Microsoft SSMS Download](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms).
   - Download the latest version of SSMS (e.g., `SSMS-Setup-ENU.exe`, ~600 MB).
   - Save it to your *Downloads* folder.
2. **Why SSMS?**:
   - SSMS is the graphical tool you’ll use to write T-SQL queries, manage databases, and explore the AdventureWorks database.

### Step 5: Install SSMS
1. **Run the SSMS Installer**:
   - Double-click the downloaded file (e.g., `SSMS-Setup-ENU.exe`).
   - Click *Yes* for UAC if prompted.
2. **Follow the Installation Wizard**:
   - Accept the default installation path (e.g., `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio 20`).
   - Click *Install* (takes 5–10 minutes).
3. **Verify Installation**:
   - After installation, search for *SQL Server Management Studio* in the Windows Start menu and open it.
   - If it launches, you’re ready to connect to SQL Server.

### Step 6: Connect to SQL Server Using SSMS
1. **Open SSMS**:
   - Launch SSMS from the Start menu.
2. **Connect to Your SQL Server Instance**:
   - In the *Connect to Server* window:
     - **Server Type**: Select *Database Engine*.
     - **Server Name**: Enter the server name from Step 3 (e.g., `localhost` or `YOUR-PC-NAME\MSSQLSERVER`).
     - **Authentication**: Choose *Windows Authentication* (uses your Windows login).
   - Click *Connect*.
3. **Troubleshooting Connection Issues**:
   - If connection fails:
     - Ensure SQL Server is running: Open *SQL Server Configuration Manager* and check that *SQL Server (MSSQLSERVER)* is running.
     - Verify the server name is correct.
     - Check your firewall allows SQL Server (port 1433).
   - If issues persist, note the error message and ask your instructor or use the *Ask to Learn* feature on OnlineVarsity.

### Step 7: Download and Install AdventureWorks 2022
1. **Download the Sample Database**:
   - Go to [Microsoft’s AdventureWorks Download Page](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/samples/adventureworks-install-configure).
   - Download the *AdventureWorks2022.bak* backup file (~200 MB).
   - Save it to a folder like `C:\Backups`.
2. **Restore the Database in SSMS**:
   - Open SSMS and connect to your SQL Server instance.
   - Right-click *Databases* in Object Explorer and select *Restore Database*.
   - In the *Restore Database* window:
     - Select *Device* and click the *…* button.
     - Click *Add* and browse to `C:\Backups\AdventureWorks2022.bak`.
     - Click *OK* to select the file.
     - Ensure the *Database* field shows *AdventureWorks2022*.
     - Click *OK* to restore (takes 1–5 minutes).
3. **Verify the Database**:
   - In Object Explorer, expand *Databases* and confirm *AdventureWorks2022* appears.
   - Expand *AdventureWorks2022 > Tables* to see tables like `Production.Product` and `Sales.Customer`.

### Step 8: Test Your Setup
1. **Run a Sample Query**:
   - In SSMS, click *New Query* in the toolbar.
   - Enter the following T-SQL query:
     ```sql
     SELECT TOP 5 FirstName, LastName
     FROM Person.Person;
     ```
   - Click *Execute* (F5) or the *Execute* button.
   - You should see a result set with five names from the AdventureWorks database.
2. **Check Results**:
   - If results appear, your setup is working!
   - If you get an error, double-check your server connection or database restoration.

### Step 9: Prepare for the Course
1. **Access OnlineVarsity**:
   - Log in to OnlineVarsity (details provided by your instructor).
   - Download the *Learner’s Guide* (eBook) for *Data Management with SQL Server*.
   - Explore the *Glossary* and *Practice 4 Me* sections for Session 1 and 2 content.
2. **Organize Your Environment**:
   - Create a folder (e.g., `C:\SQLScripts`) to save your `.sql` files.
   - Bookmark the AdventureWorks schema documentation for reference.
3. **Explore SSMS**:
   - Spend 10–15 minutes browsing Object Explorer to view the *AdventureWorks2022* database structure (e.g., tables, columns).

## Troubleshooting Tips
- **Installation Fails**: Ensure you have admin privileges and enough disk space. Restart your PC and try again.
