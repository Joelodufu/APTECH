## Sub-Session 4: Transact-SQL Language Elements

### Definition
Transact-SQL (T-SQL) language elements are the building blocks used to construct queries and scripts in SQL Server. These include **variables**, **operators**, **predicates**, **expressions**, **comments**, and **batches**, which together enable dynamic and structured database programming.

### Explanation
- **Variables**: Used to store temporary data for use within a T-SQL script. Variables are declared with a data type and can hold values like numbers, strings, or dates. Example: `DECLARE @TotalSales MONEY;`.
- **Operators**: Symbols or keywords that perform operations on data, such as arithmetic (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`), comparison (`=`, `>`, `<`, `!=`), and logical (`AND`, `OR`, `NOT`).
- **Predicates**: Conditions in queries that evaluate to `TRUE` or `FALSE`, used to filter data (e.g., `WHERE UnitPrice > 50`).
- **Expressions**: Combinations of values, operators, and functions that produce a result (e.g., `ListPrice * 0.9` to calculate a discounted price).
- **Comments**: Notes within code for documentation. Single-line comments use `--`, while multi-line comments use `/* */`.
- **Batches**: A group of T-SQL statements executed together, separated by the `GO` keyword. Batches are useful for organizing scripts and controlling execution scope.

### Detailed Examples
Below are multiple examples using the **AdventureWorks2022** database to illustrate each T-SQL language element.

#### Example 1: Using Variables and Predicates
```sql
USE AdventureWorks2022;
-- Declare a variable to store a price threshold
DECLARE @PriceThreshold DECIMAL(10,2) = 200.00;
-- Query products with a predicate and expression
SELECT ProductID, Name, ListPrice, (ListPrice * 1.15) AS IncreasedPrice
FROM Production.Product
WHERE ListPrice > @PriceThreshold; -- Predicate using variable
/* This query retrieves products with a list price above the threshold
   and calculates a 15% price increase */
```

**Explanation**:
- **Variable**: `@PriceThreshold` stores a decimal value.
- **Predicate**: `ListPrice > @PriceThreshold` filters rows.
- **Expression**: `(ListPrice * 1.15)` calculates a new price.
- **Comments**: Single-line (`--`) and multi-line (`/* */`) comments explain the code.

#### Example 2: Using Operators and Comments
```sql
USE AdventureWorks2022;
-- Declare variables for filtering
DECLARE @MinStock INT = 100;
DECLARE @MaxStock INT = 500;
-- Query products with stock between min and max
SELECT ProductID, Name, SafetyStockLevel
FROM Production.Product
WHERE SafetyStockLevel BETWEEN @MinStock AND @MaxStock; -- Using BETWEEN operator
/* This query retrieves products where stock levels are within
   the specified range */
```

**Explanation**:
- **Variables**: `@MinStock` and `@MaxStock` define a range.
- **Operator**: `BETWEEN` simplifies the predicate.
- **Comments**: Provide context for the queryâ€™s purpose.

#### Example 3: Using Batches
```sql
USE AdventureWorks2022;
-- Batch 1: Declare and set a variable
DECLARE @CategoryID INT = 1;
SELECT ProductID, Name
FROM Production.Product
WHERE ProductSubcategoryID = @CategoryID;
GO
-- Batch 2: Update the variable and run another query
SET @CategoryID = 2;
SELECT ProductID, Name
FROM Production.Product
WHERE ProductSubcategoryID = @CategoryID;
GO
```

**Explanation**:
- **Batch**: The `GO` keyword separates two batches, each executing independently.
- **Variable**: `@CategoryID` is reused across batches with different values.

### Class Work
1. **Identification Activity**:
   - **Task**: Given the following T-SQL script, identify the variables, operators, predicates, expressions, and comments:
     ```sql
     USE AdventureWorks2022;
     -- Declare variables for filtering
     DECLARE @MinPrice DECIMAL(10,2) = 50.00;
     DECLARE @Color NVARCHAR(15) = 'Black';
     /* Query to find products matching price and color */
     SELECT ProductID, Name, ListPrice, (ListPrice * 0.85) AS DiscountedPrice
     FROM Production.Product
     WHERE ListPrice >= @MinPrice AND Color = @Color;
     ```
   - **Expected Output**: Students should list:
     - Variables: `@MinPrice`, `@Color`
     - Operators: `>=`, `AND`, `*`
     - Predicate: `ListPrice >= @MinPrice AND Color = @Color`
     - Expression: `(ListPrice * 0.85)`
     - Comments: `-- Declare variables for filtering`, `/* Query to find products matching price and color */`

2. **Lab Exercise**: Write a T-SQL script that:
   - Declares a variable `@MaxPrice` (type `DECIMAL(10,2)`) and sets it to 1000.00.
   - Queries the `Production.Product` table to retrieve `ProductID`, `Name`, and `ListPrice` for products where `ListPrice` is less than or equal to `@MaxPrice`.
   - Calculates a 10% discount in a column named `DiscountedPrice`.
   - Includes single-line and multi-line comments explaining the script.
   - Save as `LanguageElements.sql`.

3. **Challenge Exercise**: Write a T-SQL script with two batches:
   - Batch 1: Declares a variable `@MinStock` (type `INT`) set to 200 and queries `Production.Product` for products where `SafetyStockLevel > @MinStock`.
   - Batch 2: Updates `@MinStock` to 500 and repeats the query.
   - Include comments and save as `BatchExample.sql`.

### Learning Objectives
- Understand how to declare and use variables for dynamic queries.
- Apply operators and predicates to filter data effectively.
- Use expressions to compute derived values.
- Implement comments for clear documentation.
- Use batches to organize and execute multiple statements.

## Sub-Session 5: Sets and Predicate Logic

### Definition
- **Sets**: In SQL Server, a set is a collection of rows (e.g., a table or query result). T-SQL provides set operations like `UNION`, `INTERSECT`, and `EXCEPT` to combine or compare sets.
- **Predicate Logic**: Logical conditions used in T-SQL to filter data based on `TRUE` or `FALSE` evaluations, typically in `WHERE` or `HAVING` clauses.

### Explanation
- **Sets**:
  - SQL Server processes data as sets, not individual rows, which enables efficient querying of large datasets.
  - **Set Operations**:
    - `UNION`: Combines rows from two queries, removing duplicates.
    - `UNION ALL`: Combines rows without removing duplicates (faster).
    - `INTERSECT`: Returns rows common to both queries.
    - `EXCEPT`: Returns rows in the first query but not in the second.
- **Predicate Logic**:
  - Predicates are conditions that evaluate to `TRUE` or `FALSE` (e.g., `ListPrice > 100`).
  - Logical operators (`AND`, `OR`, `NOT`) combine predicates to create complex filters.
  - Predicates are used in `WHERE` (to filter rows) and `HAVING` (to filter groups).

### Detailed Examples
Below are examples using the **AdventureWorks2022** database to demonstrate sets and predicate logic.

#### Example 1: UNION Set Operation
```sql
USE AdventureWorks2022;
-- Combine products from two subcategories
SELECT ProductID, Name
FROM Production.Product
WHERE ProductSubcategoryID = 1 -- Mountain Bikes
UNION
SELECT ProductID, Name
FROM Production.Product
WHERE ProductSubcategoryID = 2; -- Road Bikes
```

**Explanation**:
- **Set Operation**: `UNION` combines rows from two queries, ensuring no duplicates.
- **Predicate**: `ProductSubcategoryID = 1` and `ProductSubcategoryID = 2` filter specific subcategories.

#### Example 2: INTERSECT Set Operation
```sql
USE AdventureWorks2022;
-- Find products that are both expensive and black
SELECT ProductID, Name
FROM Production.Product
WHERE ListPrice > 1000
INTERSECT
SELECT ProductID, Name
FROM Production.Product
WHERE Color = 'Black';
```

**Explanation**:
- **Set Operation**: `INTERSECT` returns products that satisfy both conditions.
- **Predicate**: `ListPrice > 1000` and `Color = 'Black'` define the sets.

#### Example 3: Predicate Logic with Complex Conditions
```sql
USE AdventureWorks2022;
-- Find sales orders with specific conditions
SELECT SalesOrderID, OrderDate, TotalDue
FROM Sales.SalesOrderHeader
WHERE TotalDue > 5000 AND (OrderDate >= '2020-01-01' OR CustomerID = 11000);
```

**Explanation**:
- **Predicate Logic**: `TotalDue > 5000` and `(OrderDate >= '2020-01-01' OR CustomerID = 11000)` combine conditions using `AND` and `OR`.
- Filters sales orders with high totals in 2020 or for a specific customer.

#### Example 4: EXCEPT Set Operation
```sql
USE AdventureWorks2022;
-- Find products in subcategory 1 but not black
SELECT ProductID, Name
FROM Production.Product
WHERE ProductSubcategoryID = 1
EXCEPT
SELECT ProductID, Name
FROM Production.Product
WHERE Color = 'Black';
```

**Explanation**:
- **Set Operation**: `EXCEPT` returns products in subcategory 1 that are not black.
- **Predicate**: Filters based on `ProductSubcategoryID` and `Color`.

### Class Work
1. **Set Operation Lab**:
   - **Task**: Write a T-SQL query using `UNION ALL` to combine products from `Production.Product` where `Color = 'Red'` and `Color = 'Blue'`. Include columns `ProductID`, `Name`, and `Color`. Add comments and save as `SetOperationUnionAll.sql`.
   - **Bonus**: Modify the query to use `UNION` and compare the results.

2. **Predicate Logic Exercise**:
   - **Task**: Write a query to retrieve `Sales.SalesOrderHeader` records where `TotalDue > 2000` and `OrderDate` is between January 1, 2019, and December 31, 2020. Use `AND` and `BETWEEN` operators. Include `SalesOrderID`, `OrderDate`, and `TotalDue`. Save as `PredicateLogicSales.sql`.

3. **Challenge Exercise**:
   - **Task**: Write a query using `INTERSECT` to find products in `Production.Product` that have `ListPrice > 1000` and `SafetyStockLevel > 500`. Then, write a second query using `EXCEPT` to find products with `ListPrice > 1000` but not in `ProductSubcategoryID = 1`. Save as `SetOperationsAdvanced.sql`.

### Learning Objectives
- Understand how to manipulate sets using `UNION`, `INTERSECT`, and `EXCEPT`.
- Apply predicate logic to create precise filters with logical operators.
- Differentiate between `UNION` and `UNION ALL` for performance considerations.
- Practice writing complex conditions in `WHERE` clauses.

## Sub-Session 6: Logical Order of Operators in the SELECT Statement

### Definition
The logical order of operators in a T-SQL `SELECT` statement is the sequence in which SQL Server processes the clauses to produce the query result. This differs from the order in which the query is written.

### Explanation
- **Logical Order**:
  1. **FROM**: Identifies the table(s) or view(s) to query.
  2. **WHERE**: Filters individual rows based on predicates.
  3. **GROUP BY**: Groups rows with matching values in specified columns.
  4. **HAVING**: Filters groups based on aggregate conditions.
  5. **SELECT**: Specifies the columns or expressions to return.
  6. **ORDER BY**: Sorts the final result set.
- **Key Points**:
  - The written order (`SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE`, etc.) is for human readability, but SQL Server follows the logical order for execution.
  - Understanding this order helps predict query behavior, optimize performance, and troubleshoot errors.
  - For example, aliases defined in `SELECT` cannot be used in `WHERE` because `WHERE` is processed first.

### Detailed Examples
Below are examples using the **AdventureWorks2022** database to illustrate the logical order.

#### Example 1: Basic SELECT with Logical Order
```sql
USE AdventureWorks2022;
SELECT ProductID, Name, ListPrice
FROM Production.Product
WHERE ListPrice > 100
ORDER BY ListPrice DESC;
```

**Logical Processing**:
1. **FROM**: Accesses `Production.Product`.
2. **WHERE**: Filters rows where `ListPrice > 100`.
3. **SELECT**: Retrieves `ProductID`, `Name`, and `ListPrice`.
4. **ORDER BY**: Sorts results by `ListPrice` in descending order.

#### Example 2: GROUP BY and HAVING
```sql
USE AdventureWorks2022;
SELECT ProductSubcategoryID, COUNT(*) AS ProductCount, AVG(ListPrice) AS AvgPrice
FROM Production.Product
WHERE ListPrice > 0
GROUP BY ProductSubcategoryID
HAVING COUNT(*) > 10
ORDER BY AvgPrice DESC;
```

**Logical Processing**:
1. **FROM**: Accesses `Production.Product`.
2. **WHERE**: Filters rows where `ListPrice > 0`.
3. **GROUP BY**: Groups rows by `ProductSubcategoryID`.
4. **HAVING**: Keeps groups with more than 10 products.
5. **SELECT**: Computes `COUNT(*)` and `AVG(ListPrice)` for each group.
6. **ORDER BY**: Sorts by `AvgPrice` descending.

#### Example 3: Complex Query with Joins
```sql
USE AdventureWorks2022;
SELECT p.ProductID, p.Name, sc.Name AS Subcategory
FROM Production.Product p
JOIN Production.ProductSubcategory sc ON p.ProductSubcategoryID = sc.ProductSubcategoryID
WHERE p.ListPrice > 500
ORDER BY p.ListPrice DESC;
```

**Logical Processing**:
1. **FROM**: Joins `Production.Product` and `Production.ProductSubcategory` using `ON`.
2. **WHERE**: Filters rows where `ListPrice > 500`.
3. **SELECT**: Retrieves `ProductID`, `Name`, and `Subcategory` (aliased).
4. **ORDER BY**: Sorts by `ListPrice` descending.

### Class Work
1. **Logical Order Analysis**:
   - **Task**: For the following query, describe the logical order of processing:
     ```sql
     USE AdventureWorks2022;
     SELECT CustomerID, COUNT(*) AS OrderCount
     FROM Sales.SalesOrderHeader
     WHERE OrderDate >= '2020-01-01'
     GROUP BY CustomerID
     HAVING COUNT(*) > 5
     ORDER BY OrderCount DESC;
     ```
   - **Expected Output**: Students should list the steps in logical order with explanations.

2. **Lab Exercise**:
   - **Task**: Write a T-SQL query to:
     - Retrieve `ProductSubcategoryID` and the total `ListPrice` (as `TotalPrice`) from `Production.Product`.
     - Filter rows where `ListPrice > 200`.
     - Group by `ProductSubcategoryID`.
     - Only include groups with total `ListPrice > 5000`.
     - Sort by total price descending.
     - Save as `LogicalOrderQuery.sql`.

3. **Challenge Exercise**:
   - **Task**: Write a query to join `Sales.SalesOrderHeader` and `Sales.SalesOrderDetail` to find the total `LineTotal` per `SalesOrderID` for orders placed in 2019. Use `GROUP BY`, `HAVING` (total `LineTotal > 10000`), and `ORDER BY`. Save as `OrderTotalQuery.sql`.

### Learning Objectives
- Understand the logical order of T-SQL query processing.
- Recognize how the logical order affects query results and performance.
- Write queries that leverage `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, and `ORDER BY` correctly.
- Troubleshoot errors caused by incorrect clause usage (e.g., using `SELECT` aliases in `WHERE`).

### Additional Notes for Students
- **Practice Environment**: Ensure you have access to the **AdventureWorks2022** database in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) or a compatible tool.
- **File Naming**: Save all scripts with descriptive names (e.g., `LanguageElements.sql`) for easy reference.
- **Testing Queries**: Run each query to verify results and understand the output. Use `SELECT TOP 10` for large datasets to avoid overwhelming results.
- **Commenting**: Always include comments in your scripts to explain the purpose and logic, as this is a best practice in database programming.
- **Debugging Tip**: If a query fails, check the logical order and ensure predicates and expressions use valid column names and data types.

### Expected Outcomes
By completing the examples and classwork, students will:
- Gain proficiency in writing T-SQL scripts using variables, operators, predicates, and set operations.
- Understand how SQL Server processes queries logically and apply this knowledge to optimize queries.
- Build practical experience with the **AdventureWorks2022** database, preparing them for real-world database tasks.
