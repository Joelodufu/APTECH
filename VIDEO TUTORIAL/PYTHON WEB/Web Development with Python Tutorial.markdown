### Intro (0:00 - 0:45)
**[Visual: Presenter on screen with a welcoming background, course title slide: "Web Development with Python"]**

**Presenter**:  
"Welcome to *Web Development with Python*! Whether you're a beginner looking to build your first web app or an intermediate developer wanting to master Python frameworks, this course is for you. In this series, we’ll cover everything from setting up your environment to building full-stack applications with Flask and Django. By the end, you’ll have the skills to create dynamic, database-driven web applications. Let’s dive in!"

### Module 1: Introduction to Web Development & Python (0:45 - 3:00)
**[Visual: Slide with bullet points and code snippets]**

**Presenter**:  
"Let’s start with Module 1: Introduction to Web Development and Python. Web development is split into front-end—what users see—and back-end, the server-side logic. Python is perfect for back-end development due to its simplicity and powerful frameworks. Today, we’ll set up your development environment and refresh your Python basics."

**[Visual: Screen recording of installing Python, VS Code, and virtualenv]**  
"First, download Python from python.org and install VS Code. Then, use `pip install virtualenv` to create isolated environments. Let’s create one now: `python -m venv myenv` and activate it."

**[Visual: Code snippet of Python basics]**  
"We’ll also cover Python essentials like variables, loops, functions, and classes to get you ready for web development."

---

### Module 2: Introduction to HTTP and Web Architecture (3:00 - 5:30)
**[Visual: Diagram of client-server model and HTTP flow]**  

**Presenter**:  
"Module 2 is all about how the web works. HTTP is the protocol that powers the internet, using requests and responses between clients and servers. URLs point to resources, and DNS translates domain names to IP addresses."

**[Visual: Animation of request-response cycle]**  
"Here’s how it works: a browser sends a request to a server, which responds with data, like HTML or JSON. Web servers like Apache, Nginx, or Gunicorn handle these requests. We’ll also touch on APIs and JSON, which are key for modern web apps."

---

### Module 3: Web Development with Flask (5:30 - 8:00)
**[Visual: Code editor with Flask app code]**  

**Presenter**:  
"Now, let’s build with Flask, a lightweight Python framework. Flask is great for small to medium projects. Let’s create our first Flask app."

**[Visual: Screen recording of Flask setup]**  
"Install Flask with `pip install flask`, then write a simple app. Here’s a basic example:"

```python
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def home():
    return 'Hello, Flask!'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

"Run this, and you’ll see ‘Hello, Flask!’ in your browser. We’ll also explore URL routing, Jinja2 templates for dynamic pages, and form handling to process user input."

---

### Module 4: Flask with Databases (8:00 - 10:30)
**[Visual: Database diagram and SQLAlchemy code]**  

**Presenter**:  
"In Module 4, we connect Flask to databases using SQLite and SQLAlchemy, an Object-Relational Mapper. This lets us store and manage data easily."

**[Visual: Screen recording of database setup]**  
"Install SQLAlchemy with `pip install flask-sqlalchemy`, then define models like this:"

```python
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy
app = Flask(__name__)
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'sqlite:///site.db'
db = SQLAlchemy(app)

class User(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    username = db.Column(db.String(20), unique=True)
```

"We’ll cover CRUD operations—Create, Read, Update, Delete—and integrate forms to save user input to the database."

---

### Module 5: Web Development with Django (10:30 - 13:00)
**[Visual: Django project structure slide]**  

**Presenter**:  
"Finally, Module 5 introduces Django, a full-stack framework for rapid development. Django handles everything from routing to databases."

**[Visual: Screen recording of Django setup]**  
"Install Django with `pip install django`, then create a project with `django-admin startproject myproject`. We’ll build apps, define URLs, create views, and use Django’s Template Language for dynamic pages."

**[Visual: Django template example]**  
"Here’s a simple Django template:"

```html
<h1>Welcome, {{ user.name }}!</h1>
```

"Django makes building complex apps straightforward and secure."

---

### Outro (13:00 - 13:30)
**[Visual: Presenter on screen with course title and call-to-action slide]**  

**Presenter**:  
"That’s a wrap for our *Web Development with Python* tutorial! You’ve learned how to set up a Python environment, understand web architecture, and build apps with Flask and Django.
